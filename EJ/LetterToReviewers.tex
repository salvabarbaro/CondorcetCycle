\noindent Dear Amanda, Dear Reviewers,


First and foremost, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude for the very constructive and exceptionally profound evaluations. Your assessments were highly motivating. Your insightful comments have significantly contributed to enhancing the quality and rigour of our work. In response, we have thoroughly revised the manuscript.

For the sake of easier reference, I have taken the liberty of highlighting your comments in colour. This way, you can easily see how we have addressed the specific remarks. For the sake of improved readability, we have taken the liberty of summarising some comments briefly. This is by no means intended to imply a judgment, but rather to focus on the central essence of each remark.

Before diving into details, we would like to provide an overview of the significant changes compared to the initial version.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item We reformulate the introduction, avoiding technical jargon, to make the research note appealing to a wider audience. The introduction concisely reports the current state of research, highlights the expressed demand for a comprehensive empirical study (Sen 2017), whereby making clear the novelty of our research.
\item We carefully revised our data and clearly separate parliamentary and presidential elections in our analyses. We utilised an updated and enhanced version of the data set, which could not considered for the initial version. The revised version focuses on 212 parliamentary elections and 41 presidential elections. 
\item Based on the reviewers' comments, we add a systematic analysis of the performance of Condorcet winners and losers across election type and electoral formulae, differentiating for electoral victory and winning different types of office. Aside from the main insight that the Condorcet paradox has virtually no empirical relevance, this part is also a pioneering assessment on how the Condorcet-winner parties achieve political influence. 
\item We also assess Condorcet losers and provide evidence for the so-called Borda paradox (where the Condorcet loser emerges as election winner). Furthermore, we relate our results more accurately to existing research.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Editor}
\begin{changes}
How novel is the result?
\end{changes}
Empirical studies on the occurrence of the Condorcet Paradox in democratic elections are scarce, especially for general elections. Existing research focused mostly on the US, and on Denmark, revealing two likely cases of a Condorcet Paradox. However, comparative evidence on parliamentary and presidential elections is largely absent, especially concerning non-Western democracies. We explicitly address this research gap in the revised version of the manuscript, and clearly state our marginal contribution: That we are the first to investigate prevalence of Condorcet paradox for a broad range of democratic elections across the globe. Our contribution is furthermore unique in that we also present descriptive results on the identity of Condorcet winners and losers, and on the Condorcet efficiency of electoral systems. 

\begin{changes}
	What drives the result?
\end{changes}


\begin{changes}
	Empirical strategy.
\end{changes}

\section{R1} 
\begin{changes}
1. Should we not worry that the preferences reported in polls are affected by the electoral system? I do not worry here about misrepresenting true preferences, but my preference over parties may be different in a system with majority voting where the winner then governs unchallenged than in a parliamentary system where I expect even the winner party to have to form a coalition? It would be good to have some discussion of this.
\end{changes}

We agree that the patterns of national preference profiles reflect to some extend the institutional design of a country's electoral system. The number of viable parties/candidates will be lower in majoritarian systems than in proportional systems, and we know from the literature that the number of candidates increases the likelihood of a Condorcet Paradox. However, respondents will likely express more indifferences between parties that are ideologically close and/or coalition partners in large party sytems, a pattern which we will rather not observe in presidential systems or Westminster-type systems. Indifferences reduce the likelihood of a Condorcet Paradox. Therefore it is hard to assess how the institutional impact on preference profiles will influence the occurrence of Condorcet Paradoxes. Yet, we do not think of these institutional influences as a disturbance parameter to the preference profiles, but are instead interested in the occurrence of Condorcet Paradoxes given these real-world empirical preference distributions over national political parties and candidates as they are. To be clear, our aim is not to make claims about how voters would vote under the Condorcet method as an alternative to their national electoral system, but we want to investigate whether their true, empirical preferences over the national parties or candidates lead to a majority cycle. Since we do not expect nor observe notable differences in the occurrence of the Paradox across electoral systems, we refrain from discussing this point to keep the research note as concise as possible.

\begin{changes}
	2. I like that the authors attempt to characterize who the Condorcet winners typically are, and in particular, how much support the Condorcet losers typically get. I thought, though that this part of the paper could be a bit more expanded. For example, the last sentence of the conclusion says that "Condorcet loser parties often benefit from the actual voting methods", but the paper only gives one example of such a thing happening. Some quantification of this statement in the paper would be helpful. Similarly, there is an example of D66, a party that was a Condorcet winner but received very few votes. How frequent are such examples?
\end{changes}

Thanks for that suggestion, which we followed up in our revision of the manuscript. Concretely, we expand the discussion of the electoral performance of selected Condorcet winners and losers in lines 217-233 of the revised manuscript.  Furthermore, we report statistics on the performance of Condorcet losers and winners in Table 2. It shows that government participation of Condorcet losers is indeed quite rate, but does happen in systems of proportional representation. There is one instance where the Condorcet loser become president. We discuss these results lines 266-280 in the main text.

\begin{changes}
	3. I enjoyed learning that in 85\% of the election sight a Condorcet winner that party ended up in the government. I have two questions, though. First, what does "ending up in the government" mean? How many times did the Condorcet winner become the coalition leader, that is, won the highest number of seats? And if it is close to 85\%, I would like to see some discussion how likely this is far from 100\%. I understand that one cannot put a standard confidence interval on that, but perhaps one can have a discussion based on the typical margin of error that the polls are expected to have and how frequently the election results actually defy the polls. 
\end{changes}

Thanks for raising that question, which we can hopefully give a satisfactory answer to in Table 2 of the revised manuscript. The table separately reports the frequencies at which Condorcet winners become the largest electoral party, at which they become prime minister/president, and at which the hold any government post. We further present Bootstrap-confidence-intervals to account for uncertainty in our sample. We hope that the insights generated by Table 2 will be of high interest to a broader audience and thank the reviewer for their suggestion.

\subsection{Main Comments}
\begin{changes}
	The result is very interesting with great data but makes the reader wanting a thorough discussion. For example, the paper would benefit from a mechanism exploration for general interest journal like EJ. In some sense it’s a descriptive analysis of the Condorcet issue (which is an important first step), but the next step is to determine what factors correlate with it. There is some exploratory analysis along this line, but is based only on party. It would be interesting to also analyze countries / institutional differences. The authors should investigate what specific factors (e.g., electoral systems, political culture, party fragmentation) correlate with the presence or absence of Condorcet winners. A first start would be to look at other work; do the papers
	that this paper improves over do anything more than just counting winners/losers? I understand that finding variables to study mechanisms in this cross-country context may be very difficult.
\end{changes}

Thank your for raising the point of mechanism exploration, which we agree to be an important point. You are right in stating that our analysis remains descriptive and does not answer the question of \textit{why} there are virtually no Condorcet Paradoxes. For such an analysis, we simply lack the necessary variance. Since we also find this unsatisfactory, we discuss the role of single-peakedness of the preference profiles in leading to the non-occurrence of Condorcet Paradoxes. We conduct an additional analysis (presented in the Online appendix D), to investigate to what extent individual party ratings are shaped by ideological left-right distances. The results reveal that left-right distance between respondent and party is a significant predictor of party ratings throughout the whole sample. The effect is general, and there is no significant variation across countries. Although we cannot prove that this is explains the absence of Condorcet Paradoxes, it suggests that preference profiles follow ideological orderings of parties, and that this leads to a sufficiently large number of single-peaked preferences within the national samples to prevent the existence of a majority cycle. Yet, since we find practically no instance of a Condorcet Paradox, we cannot provide any statistical test on this relation, and leave it for future research to investigate the underlying mechanism. We include a brief discussion of the potential mechanism in lines 180-196.

Instead, we focus on Condorcet efficiency across electoral systems and reveal significant variation between parliamentary and presidential elections, as well as between different electoral formulae. For the sake of brevity given the format of a research note, we keep these analyses at a descriptive level and hope that the variation we detect stimulates further research on institutional drivers of Condorcet efficiency.  

\begin{changes}
	Related to the last point, how do the results change compared to the older papers that use worse data? Understanding the bias of those papers and how it shows up in the results would be illuminating (and boost the argument for contribution). I understand this may be difficult if the elections don’t overlap (like their discussion on the Van	Deemen and Vergunst), but just an overall result comparison may be useful.
\end{changes}

New intro referring more to the van Deemen survey. Data in previous studies rather artificial.

\begin{changes}
	Why is this relevant beyond theoretical interest? Is there evidence policymakers take Condorcet paradox into account when devising voting rules? If so, you can quantify the extent of the over-correction. Overall, more discussion and some real-world policy relevance / recommendation would benefit the reader.
\end{changes}

Ongoing discussion on electoral reforms. Condorcet was frequently left aside (too early) because of the threat of indeterminacy. Such concern can be addressed now more carefully.

\begin{changes}
	If the number of Condorcet paradoxes in the data is ``surprisingly'' small (from a theory perspective), what explains the discrepancy? Are there nuances to the electoral systems that make them more complex than the idealized models?
\end{changes}

Anna Regression.

\begin{changes}
	For a general interest audience, more discussion on the Condorcet paradox (winner/loser) is needed. The concise definition in the intro doesn’t feel sufficient.
\end{changes}

New intro.

\subsection{Minor Comments}
\begin{changes}
	More details on data. For example, why just 1996/2004 for the US? The reform party only did well in 1992/1996. What about Nader in 2000 with the greens? Is this scattered years list simply based on what CSES has (my guess for why 1992 is missing) or are there additional data processing steps that removed some years?
\end{changes}

To be explained.

\begin{changes}
	Other recent work that may be relevant for authors to compare to: \cite{Desai2025, Darmann2019}.
\end{changes}

\citeauthor{Darmann2019}: little differences among voting systems, bootstrapping


\begin{changes}
Alternative measure / aggregation rule to see how things change?
\end{changes}

Condorcet efficiency table. Alternative measures: Borda, STV. 

\begin{changes}
	The mention of non-reporting of null results is interesting but is the claim that some authors sought evidence, presented, but did not end up publishing results a guess or based on knowledge? If the latter, the presentations could be cited.
\end{changes}

We have removed this part, because, indeed, the claim is a guess.

\begin{changes}
	Typo in Figure 1 for Conservative.
\end{changes}
Thank you for pointing on this. We have amended the caption. 

\newpage
\section{R3}
%\begin{changes}
%	My main concern is that the current manuscript looks more like a short technical note addressed to an audience of readers who already know the topic really well, rather than a paper addressed to a broad audience of economists. The results seem interesting and 	potentially important, but I believe the paper would have to be written completely differently to do them justice.
%\end{changes}

\begin{changes}
	The authors could start by explaining in “simple” words what a Condorcet winner is and provide concrete examples to illustrate the Condorcet paradox. In its current form, the introduction immediately starts with some jargon that many readers who do not work in
	social choice theory will not know. Although most economists have heard the term Condorcet paradox before, I believe it is worth reminding everyone what that is before testing for its existence.
\end{changes}

New intro. Concise example. Importance for economic theory (stability of core economy), main aspect in Arrow's seminal impossibility theorem. 

\begin{changes}
	There is very little information about the empirical strategy. I think it would be important to provide more information on the polling data that is used (e.g., who conducts these surveys, how many respondents there are, what the sampling strategy is, etc.). It would also be
	interesting to know how the parties are classified between the different categories shown in Figure 1. Is it performed by the authors? Based on which sources?
\end{changes}

We provide more information on the CSES, e.g. information on the number of observations, as well as on the source of the party family classification.

\begin{changes}
	Similarly, it would be valuable to explain in more detail which calculations are performed to determine whether there is a Condorcet winner or not. The authors mention an R package but I think it would be important to explain what this package does exactly.
\end{changes}

\begin{changes}
	On a more substantive note, isn’t there a risk that the party ratings given by respondents are endogenously influenced by the electoral system in which these respondents vote? It could be nice to defend a bit more the assumption that these ratings can be treated as
	sincere voter preferences.
\end{changes}

\begin{changes}
	The authors ﬁnd that the “electoral systems employed work well in selecting the Condorcet winner most of the time” (p.7), which I ﬁnd very interesting. Given the richness of the data, it seems like the authors could push their analysis further and check this propensity to pick the
	Condorcet winner varies across systems and voting rules. It could be interesting to discuss whether some systems are better at picking the Condorcet winner than others. This could lead to an interesting discussion of the paper’s policy implications.
\end{changes}

Thank you. We compared electoral systems and across rules (Condorcet efficiency).

\begin{changes}
	I believe there in an inconsistency in the text as the abstract mentions 351 elections while Section 2 mentions only 221 elections.
\end{changes}
