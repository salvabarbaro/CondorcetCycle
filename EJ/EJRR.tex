\begin{abstract}
The Condorcet paradox has been a significant focus of investigation since Kenneth Arrow rediscovered its importance for economic theory. Recent research on this phenomenon has oscillated between simulation studies, probability calculations based on hypothetical voter preferences, and empirical analyses often limited by unsatisfactory data. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of \nbelections electoral polls conducted across \nbcountries countries. Our findings demonstrate that the Condorcet paradox has virtually no empirical relevance: with only one exception, we find no evidence of cyclical majorities in any of the \nbelections elections. This result remains robust after statistical inference testing. Furthermore, this study provides insights into which parties are particularly likely to emerge as Condorcet winners and explores how these Condorcet winners assert themselves after elections.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec.intro}
The ideal of democracy demands that collective decisions reflect majority judgments. An alternative $x$ should be chosen over $y$ if more voters prefer $x$ to $y$. A \textit{Condorcet winner}—an alternative that defeats all other contestants in pairwise majority comparisons—has intuitive appeal as it aligns with the principle of majority decision \citep[Ch.~5]{Sen2017}. However, such a winner may not exist. Even when voters have transitive preferences, majority amalgamation can produce intransitive outcomes, a phenomenon known as the \textit{Condorcet paradox} \citep[][p.~lxj (76)]{Condorcet1785}. A simple example involves three voters and three candidates: Voter 1 ranks $A \succ B \succ C$, Voter 2 ranks $B \succ C \succ A$, and Voter 3 ranks $C \succ A \succ B$. Here, $A$ beats $B$ by majority, $B$ beats $C$, and $C$ beats $A$, violating transitivity.

The Condorcet paradox, intensely discussed during the French Revolution, faded into obscurity for nearly 150 years \citep[][p.~99]{Rothschild2005, McLean2019} until Arrow’s groundbreaking impossibility theorem revived its importance.  \citet{Arrow1950} demonstrated that adherence to majority principles risks indeterminate outcomes, while ensuring decisiveness requires abandoning the majority principle and possibly accepting a majority-defeated winner. In economic theory, the Condorcet paradox challenges the core stability \citep{Moulin2014}.

Despite its theoretical significance, the empirical relevance of the paradox in democratic elections remains insufficiently substantiated. The most recent survey concluded that its empirical relevance is far from settled \citep{VanDeemen2013}, largely due to a persistent lack of reliable data. Most results on the occurrence of Condorcet paradoxes are based on simulated data \citep{Lepelley2001, Gehrlein2006, Sauermann2022}, or on non-political elections, like electing the head of an academic association \citep{Chamberlin1984, Feld1992, Regenwetter2007, Tideman2009, Popov2014}.

Empirical studies of real-world (democratic) elections have primarily focused on single elections \citep{Kurrild2018, Darmann2019, Potthoff2021}, or on country-specific case studies (i.e., multiple elections within a single country) \citep{Abramson1995, vanDeemen1998, KurrildKlitgaard2001, KurrildKlitgaard2008}. Although instances of the Condorcet paradox have been identified, these studies have failed to provide conclusive insights into its prevalence. So far, empirical research has largely relied on small survey datasets or limited samples. Some studies were based solely on plurality data \citep[e.g.,][]{Riker1988} or voting intentions \citep[e.g.,][]{McDonald2012}, requiring the preference orderings to be estimated. Adding to the challenge is the observation that most studies refrain from making claims about statistical inference. Notable exceptions include \cite{Desai2025, Regenwetter2007, Darmann2019}, with the latter two explicitly assessing the robustness of their findings through bootstrap methods.

Eminent economists have recently advocated for electoral reforms in favour of the Condorcet method, even beyond the academic realm \citep{Maskin2016, Maskin2017, Maskin2017a}. In this public discourse, the Condorcet paradox is the unresolved core issue, as it is—alongside the debate over whether cardinal information should be considered—the main argument against the practical implementation of the Condorcet method.

\citet[Ch.~10.2]{Sen2017} highlighted the necessity of determining the relevance of the Condorcet paradox through a comprehensive empirical analysis as a basis for advancing discussions on electoral reforms. Such a study should ideally cover various points in time and different societies. Motivated by this research desideratum, our work presents a comprehensive study that examines the occurrence of the Condorcet paradox across numerous elections, spanning multiple countries and time periods. 

We analyse data from \nbelections elections across \nbcountries countries, using nationally representative election studies provided by the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems \citep{CSES2020}. In total, our analysis incorporates responses from approximately 425,000 survey participants. On average, each election includes data from around 1,730 individuals. Our findings indicate that the Condorcet paradox has virtually no empirical relevance, a conclusion that remains robust even after accounting for statistical inference. 

Beyond this, we provide insights into who the Condorcet winners are and evaluate the extent to which different electoral systems succeed in bringing these winners to office (in candidate elections) or into government (in parliamentary elections). We also examine which parties, identified as Condorcet winners, fail to win elections. Thus, for the first time, we offer insight into the identification and success of Condorcet winners.

%This paper is closely related to \cite{Desai2025},  who identified non-empty cores across various elections and countries, analysing how often core parties assumed leadership roles in post-election governments. However, our approach differs from theirs, as will be elaborated in Section \ref{sec.results}.

\section{Data and Methods}\label{sec.datamethods}  
We use survey data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems \citep{CSES2020}. The dataset includes party and candidate ratings on a non-ipsative $11$-point like-dislike scale (\emph{integer sympathy scales}) for up to nine political parties and candidates, widely utilized in related research \citep[e.g.,][]{Kalandrakis2022, Desai2025}. Following an established procedure (most recently: \cite{Lachat2024}), we convert the ratings into individual preference orderings.\footnote{
    Based on a comprehensive dataset for Germany, where respondents provided both their ranking and their thermometer rating, \cite{Barbaro2022} showed that the orders generated by the thermometer variables have a very high correlation (measured in Kendall's $\tau$) with the directly reported orderings.
} For example, if voter $i$ rates party $A$ with $+2$, party $B$ with $+4$, and party $C$ with $+1$, this information is transformed into binary preference relations $B \succ_i A$, $A \succ_i C$. If two parties are rated equally, we consider this as indifference. We use respondents' party ratings to infer their preference orderings in parliamentary elections and their candidate ratings to infer preference rankings in presidential elections.

In total, we analyze data on \nbparliament parliamentary elections and \nbpresidential presidential elections. Restricting the CSES data to respondents who rated at least one party or candidate leaves us with 424,413 individual-level observations.\footnote{
    37,504 respondents reported no ratings, which is less than ten percent of our dataset. Respondents with incomplete ratings are included in our analysis.
} We only include elections in which more than three parties or candidates were evaluated in the dataset. As a result, we had to exclude a few elections from the analysis. This primarily affects presidential elections in the United States. While multiple candidates ran in these elections, 'like-dislike' ratings were only collected for two candidates in each case.

We treat the election survey as a representative sample of voter preferences within a single national district to determine whether a Condorcet paradox existed at a specific election. This simplification of the national electoral system is valid for our purposes because our primary interest is not in analysing how paradoxes occur while processing preferences into electoral outcomes. Instead, we focus on whether the pattern of voter preferences would lead to a Condorcet paradox if amalgamated most simply and directly, irrespective of geographic boundaries and electoral stages.

We identify the Condorcet winner and loser party for each parliamentary election. For presidential elections, we identify the Condorcet winner and loser candidate inferred from candidate ratings when possible.\footnote{
    If candidate ratings are not available, we rely on party ratings instead.
} 
We first construct party and candidate preference profiles from the rating data, as explained earlier. We then apply the Condorcet method to these preference profiles for each election separately.\footnote{
    We used the \texttt{condorcet} function in \texttt{R}'s \texttt{vote} package \citep{vote}.
}  Specifically, we calculated how many voters strictly prefer candidate $A$ over $B$ and vice versa. If a respondent rated $B$ but not $A$, we assume they prefer $B$, and the same logic applies in reverse. %Missing ratings for both candidates are excluded from determining the majority winner for that pair.\footnote{
%    These respondents will still contribute to determining the majority winner for other pairs in the same election if they provided ratings for any of the remaining candidates.

%% --> Anna: den Part mit der Indifferenz finde ich eher verwirrend, und wenn A,B jeweils NA sind, dass wir sie dann im paarweisen Vergleich ignorieren, ist eigentlich auch klar, oder?
With $\kappa$ candidates, the procedure is repeated for all $\binom{\kappa}{2}$ pairwise contests, such as $A$ vs. $C$ and $B$ vs. $C$, and so on. A party or candidate that wins each pairwise contest is identified as the Condorcet winner. An election is classified as exhibiting a Condorcet paradox if no such winner exists due to cyclical majorities, as described in the Introduction. Conversely, a party or candidate that loses all pairwise contests is referred to as the Condorcet loser.

To account for the uncertainty surrounding our survey-based results, we generate 10,000 bootstrap replications from the preference profiles of each election. Specifically, for each election we draw with replacement 10,000 samples of size $n$ from the original sample of $n$ individuals and apply the Condorcet method to each replication. For every single replication, we determine whether a Condorcet winner exists. This process results in 10,000 outcomes per election, where a Condorcet winner either exists or does not. In this way, we generate \nbboostraprep million profiles. With this approach, we adopt a method very similar to that employed by \cite{Darmann2019}.

If no paradox is observed in the original sample, we reject the null hypothesis ('no Condorcet paradox occurs') if a paradox emerges in more than 5\% of the bootstrap replications for the respective election. Conversely, if cyclical majorities are observed in an election, we reject the null hypothesis (which assumes a paradox exists) if more than 5\% of the bootstrap replications exhibit transitive preferences. 

Using the bootstrap method, we address the randomness of the sample. In addition to the bootstrap approach, we also applied a random-noise method to account for the uncertainty in the rating data. In this approach, we add a random number drawn uniformly from the interval $[-1.1, 1.1]$ (hence, $\pm$ ten percent of the total scale range) to each rating of parties or candidates. In doing so, we generated 10,000 new rating matrices for each election, which were then converted into preference orders using the procedure described above and subsequently evaluated for the presence of cyclical majorities. Thus, we obtained approximately 2.53 million replications, this time as random-noise replications. 

This procedure effectively resolves any indifference between two parties or candidates. For example, if a respondent rated two parties equally, the random-noise approach ensures that, in half of the replications, one party is rated as the better alternative. We chose this approach because the possibility of indifferences reduces the likelihood of Condorcet Paradoxes. Effectively, this allows us to test whether our central result is robust when we assume anti-symmetric (strict) preferences instead of reflexive ones.

\section{Results} \label{sec.results}
We do not find a single instance of a Condorcet paradox among the \nbparliament parliamentary elections. Among the \nbpresidential presidential elections, for which the dataset provides ratings on more than two viable candidates, we identify one case of cyclical majorities, namely the Peruvian presidential election in 2011. 

The overall picture remains robust across all bootstrap replications. With the exception of two parliamentary elections, none of the 10,000 replications conducted for each election reveal a Condorcet paradox. In one case, the phenomenon occurs in 1.1\% of the replications, while in another election, it is observed in only two out of 10,000 replications.

A similar pattern emerges for the presidential elections. In 
39 %%% check: 39 = \nbpresidential - 2 (!)
out of \nbpresidential elections, none of the respective bootstrap replications reveal a case of cyclical majorities. Even in the instance where we identified a Condorcet paradox in the sample (Peru 2011), the vast majority of replications (69.53\%) do not exhibit cyclical majorities. Consequently, we must reject the hypothesis of a Condorcet paradox occurring in this election. On the other hand, in a subsequent election in Peru in 2021, we detected Condorcet paradoxa in approximately eleven percent of the bootstrap replications. To the extent that we must reject the hypothesis of an existence of a paradox in 2011, we must equally reject the hypothesis of non-existence in 2021. In both cases, there is a strong likelihood $(69-31, 89-11)$ that no paradox is present.

A very similar pattern emerges from the evaluation of the random-noise replications. In the vast majority of cases, we find no Condorcet Paradox across the 10,000 replications for each election. In the few (25 out of \nbelections) elections where cyclical majorities do occur in the replications, they account for less than 1\% of the total replications. For no election do we find that a Condorcet Paradox occurs in more than 5\% of the replications. Exceptions, as was the case with the bootstrap analysis, are the Peruvian elections.

The literature distinguishes between a \textit{strong} and a \textit{weak} Condorcet winner \citep{Barbera2023}. While the former wins every pairwise comparison, the latter does not lose any pairwise comparison (due to ties). Except for two cases, we find strict Condorcet winners in every election.

\end{figure}

It should be noted that the presence of a Condorcet winner in an election does not necessarily imply a transitive order. Cyclical majorities can still occur even when a Condorcet winner exists. This happens when cyclical majorities appear in the middle or lower ranks. In our analysis, we observe such cases four times, including the election in Finland in 2005, which is the only instance where no Condorcet loser is present. Overall, our findings indicate that collective preferences are almost universally transitive. Note that accounting for cyclical majorities in cases with a Condorcet winner does not dilute the overall result. On the contrary, in each election, we have $\binom{\kappa}{3}$ triplets. Summed across all elections, we analyse 8,099 triplets. Among these, we find cyclical majorities in five cases (0.06\%).

%% New paragraph to address the second editor's point
Thus, we arrive—also through this approach—at the rather surprising finding that cyclical majorities are practically irrelevant from an empirical perspective. The drawback of this sharp result is that an analysis of why the Condorcet Paradox occurs so rarely is hardly possible. As is well known, empirical analyses require variance, which we do not observe. Therefore, we do not address the question of why cyclical majorities are virtually non-existent but instead encourage future research to explore this question.
%%%: should we add the regression analysis from November?

Given that Condorcet winners exist in virtually all of the elections under study, we subsequently focus on descriptive results on these winner parties and candidates. Figure \ref{f1} plots the frequency of Condorcet winners and losers by party family.\footnote{
    We use the classification of party families as provided by the CSES. It is based on expert judgments of the CSES national collaborators as to which ideological family each party belongs to. 
} It shows that Condorcet winners are most often social-democratic parties. National parties are the most common among the Condorcet losers. A full list of Condorcet winner and loser parties is presented in the (Online-)Appendix \texttt{(for the review process, the appendix is attached to this file)}. Table \ref{tab.g7} provides an extract from the full list, covering the G7 countries only.

\input{G7}

This list yields some interesting insights. For example, although Condorcet-winner parties are often centrally located within the party system, they are not necessarily large parties. In the Netherlands, for instance, the liberal party 'Democrats 66' (D66) was the Condorcet-winner party in 2010, 2017, and 2021, despite its low vote share of only 7\%, 12\%, and 15\%, respectively. In the 2010 election, it was only the sixth-largest party in terms of votes and parliamentary seats. In 2017, it ranked fourth, and in 2021, it ranked second. In an earlier study for the election year 1994---which our dataset does not extend back to---\cite{vanDeemen1998} had already found that D66 emerged as the Condorcet-winner party. Even then, the vote share of 15.5\% did not reflect the broad support for the D66 party among the electorate. We also find a correspondence with the results from two Danish elections in 1998 and 2001, as identified by \cite{KurrildKlitgaard2008} (using a different dataset than the one we employed). 

For Great Britain, our data show that the Condorcet winners can indeed vary but generally align with the winners under the First-Past-The-Post system. An exception is 2017, when the Tories narrowly won the general election, but the Labour Party emerged as the Condorcet winner. The 2005 election is not included in our dataset; however, \cite{Abramson2013} identified the Liberal-Democrats as the Condorcet winner for that election.

Our (Online-)Appendix presents the values for all other countries.

Noteworthy, there are instances where Condorcet-loser parties gain a significant number of votes and seats. Polarising parties on the far-right fringe, in particular, benefit from this imbalance. For example the 'Sweden Democrats' were the Condorcet-loser party in 2006, 2014, and 2018. Yet, they increased their vote share to 12.9\% in the 2018 election, becoming the third-largest party out of eight in the 2014 and 2018 parliaments. In Germany, the Condorcet loser AfD became the third-largest faction in the Bundestag in 2017 with 12.5\% of the vote, surpassing three parties that had each won their pairwise comparison against the AfD. An even more extreme case is the Swiss 2011 election, where the Swiss People's Party gained the largest vote share while emerging as the Condorcet loser, according to the data. %% Anna: SVP extreme right? Or should be attribute the party as conservative-right?

Table \ref{tb.efficiency} provides a systematic overview of the empirical \textit{Condorcet efficiency}\footnote{
    The term Condorcet efficiency refers to the conditional probability that a voting rule selects the Condorcet winner, given that one exists \citep{Gehrlein1998}.
} of electoral systems. We calculate how frequently Condorcet winners emerge as electoral victors (i.e., as the largest parliamentary faction) and examine how often they are included in the subsequent government following the election. The results are presented by election type and electoral formula. At the end of this section, we also report the Condorcet efficiencies of two additional voting rules. The first row of Table \ref{tb.efficiency} highlights the frequency\footnote{
    The values in square brackets indicate the confidence interval of Agresti-Coull binomial tests \citep{Agresti1998} (values in percentages and at a 90\% significance level).
} at which Condorcet winners become the largest electoral party, revealing significant variation across election types and systems. Condorcet winners are most successful in presidential elections (82\%) and parliamentary elections with mixed electoral systems (81\%), but their success rate is lowest in parliamentary elections using proportional representation (62\%). 
 
The second row in Table \ref{tb.efficiency} reports how often Condorcet winners win the prime minister's office or the presidency. It shows that in parliamentary systems with plurality or proportional rules, Condorcet winners obtain government leadership even if they are not the largest electoral party, increasing their success rate to 89\% resp. 66\%. This is not the case in any of the mixed systems in our data.  Since the most-vote getter in presidential elections typically also win the presidency, the rate is identical to the first row.  Our findings concerning parliamentary elections align with those of \cite{Desai2025}, who used OLS regressions to show that weak Condorcet winners (core parties) are about 24 percentage points more likely to appoint the prime minister, with even higher probabilities for strong Condorcet winners.

Condorcet winners may still hold government offices, e.g., as a junior coalition partner. The results reported in the third row indicate that this is often the case: the government participation rates are significantly larger than the election winner rates and the prime minister/presidency rates. Again, there is variation by election type and system, with plurality and mixed electoral systems in parliamentary elections showing the largest Condorcet efficiency in government participation (97\% and 98\%). Proportional rules in parliamentary elections are less efficient in selecting Condorcet winners into government than plurality and mixed systems (88\%).  Overall, the government formation period that follows upon parliamentary elections enhances the Condorcet efficiency of parliamentary systems, superseding presidential elections in terms of government posts for Condorcet winners.

% While our results point in the same direction, we examine a broader range of electoral systems and uncover significant differences in government participation across these systems.
%Salva: Ich habe den Teil direkt zu den Ergebnissen der prime minister geschoben. Desai untersuchen nur prime minister posts, nicht andere Formen von government participation.

Another aspect by which to evaluate the Condorcet efficiency of electoral systems is to ask for how often the government participation of the Condorcet loser is prevented. The bottom row in Table \ref{tb.efficiency} indicates that proportional electoral systems are most prone to the 'Condorcet-loser-turns-winner' \citep{vanDeemen1993} or Borda paradox (named after the Chevalier de Borda, who identified the paradoxical situation that a Condorcet loser can emerge as plurality winner). From a normative standpoint, this may be justified, as one of the premisses of proportional systems is to enable ethnic, religious or other minorities to have their legitimate share of power, so as to prevent the 'tyranny of the majority'. However, our results indicate that in only three out of 20 instances in which Condorcet losers obtain cabinet posts, it is ethnic parties. Most often (4 out of 20 cases), the Condorcet loser party that enters government is a national party. %% Anna: can we explain what a National party is? In particular, can we relate this result to the above mentioned insight that the beneficiaries are far-right parties?

%% Hier noch mal ein Text zu den USA

%Our results also reveal two instances of Condorcet losers winning presidency. This happened at the 2016 US presidential election, where Donald Trump won the presidency although being the Condorcet loser based on our results. Thus, our results confirm existing research by \citet{Potthoff2021}, who used a different data source\footnote{
%    \citet{Potthoff2021} draw on data from the American National Election Study (ANES), which also provides information on two unviable candidates, Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. The results indicate that when considering the four candidates, there was no Condorcet winner, but that Trump was the Condorcet loser.
%}, and also arrived at the conclusion that Trump was a Condorcet loser at the 2016 US election. 

The other Borda-paradox case is the 2000 Mexican presidential election, at which Vicente Fox won the plurality vote, but was a Condorcet loser. The Condorcet winner was Cuauht\'{e}moc C\'{a}rdenas Sol\'{o}rzano, who ranked third at the election.

Finally, we applied our data to the Borda rule and Single Transferable Vote (STV). The Borda rule is a positional voting system that assigns weights to alternatives based on their rank-order positions. STV, a proportional voting system, also allows voters to rank candidates by preference, with seats allocated through the redistribution of votes from elected or eliminated candidates until all positions are filled \citep{Tideman1995}. STV is used in several countries with Anglo-Saxon legacies, such as Ireland, Australia, and Malta. We compare the winners under both electoral rules with the Condorcet method and assess how often the Borda and STV winners coincide with the Condorcet winner. The results show that 93.4\% of Borda winners and 92.6\% of STV winners are also Condorcet winners. Both methods demonstrate higher Condorcet efficiency compared to the plurality rule (see Table \ref{tb.efficiency}). 

If a party is the Borda winner but not the Condorcet winner, this discrepancy arises from differences in preference intensities. The Condorcet method adheres to Arrow's Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA), which excludes any consideration of preference intensities \citep[Ch.~7]{Sen2017}. In contrast, the Borda rule accounts for preference intensities through ordinal information \citep{Maskin2024}. Assume that 60\% of the electorate prefers $A \succ B \succ C$, while 40\% prefers $B \succ C \succ A$. In this case, $A$ emerges as the Condorcet winner, while candidate $B$ becomes the Borda winner. The reason lies with candidate $C$: their middle ranking in the minority group suggests that the preference intensity between $B$ and $A$ in the smaller group is stronger than the preference intensity between $A$ and $B$ in the majority group.

When the Condorcet winner belongs to the socialist/social democratic or liberal party families, they also tend to be the Borda winner in 98\% of cases. In contrast, this coincidence is lower for the conservative/Christian democratic party family, at 85\%. Under STV, the highest overlap between Condorcet and STV winners occurs for socialist/social democratic parties (95.5\%), followed by liberal parties (93.2\%), which is lower than their overlap under the Borda rule. Conservative/Christian-democratic parties show the lowest coincidence with Condorcet winners (91.8\%).

\section{Conclusion}
Two hundred and forty years ago, the Marquis de Condorcet introduced the paradox that now bears his name to the French Academy of Sciences. Ever since, it has been recognised as a profound challenge within the social sciences. In recent decades, researchers have sought in various ways to assess the prevalence of the Condorcet paradox. However, it has always been clear that only a comprehensive empirical analysis across different countries and dates could provide a substantive answer to the question of its empirical relevance. This study leverages the availability of comparative data and advanced computational capabilities to conduct the first empirical investigation in this vein. Our findings reveal that the Condorcet paradox holds virtually no empirical relevance.

We find a Condorcet winner in almost every country and at almost every point in time. Moreover, we are able to identify who these Condorcet winners are and the party families to which they belong. Our results are encouraging in that Condorcet winners frequently succeed in becoming part of the governing coalitions. However, the degree of Condorcet efficiency varies significantly between electoral systems.

Our analysis also demonstrates that Condorcet losers nearly always exist. A concern raised by the Chevalier de Borda regarding the plurality rule was that Condorcet losers could emerge as plurality winners—a phenomenon known as the Borda paradox. We observe this paradox twice at presidential elections, but not once at parliamentary elections that use plurality rule. Our findings reveal that proportional electoral rules are the least effective in ensuring electoral victory and government participation for Condorcet winners, while simultaneously being the least effective at preventing Condorcet losers from participating in government. These insights should be carefully considered in ongoing debates about electoral reform.

Moreover, our work can be understood as academic endorsement for advocates of electoral reforms favouring the Condorcet method \citep{Maskin2016, Maskin2017, Maskin2017a}. While these advocates emphasise its axiomatic advantages, they are, of course, mindful of the paradox's challenges. Our findings suggest that, in weighing the strengths and weaknesses of the Condorcet method, its principal shortcoming should not be overemphasized. In this sense, this study aims not only to make an academic contribution but also to inform and inspire current and future debates on electoral reform.
